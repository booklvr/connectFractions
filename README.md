> Single page game to practice fractions. The game is a variation on the classic connect four game.

<h2>Objective:</h2>
<p>Create whole numbers from fractions to win points.</p>

<h2>How To Play:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Red goes first.</li>
  <li>Choose a tile.</li>
  <li>Drop the tile down a column to create a whole number from the different fractions.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    You must use at least three fractions to get a point.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You may create whole numbers from fractions in any continuous direction:</p> 
    <ul>
      <li>vertically</li>
      <li>horizontally</li>
      <li>diagonally up</li>
      <li>diagonally down</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Winning Fractions must include the dropped tile.</li>
  <li>You can create multiple fractions in the same direction or in in multiple directions.</li>
  <li>
    <p>You are awarded points for the whole number you create.  For Example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1/4 + 1/4 + 1/2 = 1  =>  is awarded one point</li>
      <li>1/2 + 3/4 + 3/4 = 2  =>  is awarded two points</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You may combine fractions that create whole numbers for extra points.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 + 3/4 + 3/4 + 1/6 + 2/6 + 3/6 = 4 points
        <ul>
          <li>1/2 + 3/4 + 3/4 + 1/6 + 2/6 + 3/6 = 3</li>
          <li>1/6 + 2/6 + 3/6 = 1</li>
          <li>*** if the dropped tile was 3/6</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The game ends when all tiles are gone or when a pre-determined amount of points are won.</li>
</ol>
